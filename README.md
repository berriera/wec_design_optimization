# wec_design_optimization
Wave energy converter design optimization, using Capytaine for hydrodynamics. Because it's open source and better.

Steps to achieve design optimization success:
1. Create simulation in Capytaine
2. Implement fitness measure to judge each design
3. Add optimization algorithm
4. Run algorithm until converged
